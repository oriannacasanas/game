# game
First Wyncode Project:

puts some data to the user introducing your game and the situation. Then ask a question and provide some options. Using the gets.chomp method, collect some user input. Use Ruby flow control to output the result of those actions, including a fallback case for random input.

Project Requirements
• Be creative (i.e. don’t do Batman).
• Your game should have at least 3 steps.
• Some questions should depend on the response to previous questions (“Choose your own adventure” style)
• Your code should not throw an error while running.
• Push yourself out of your comfort zone to explore new methods and techniques.
